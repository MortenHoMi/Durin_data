This is the git repository for the [DURIN project](https://betweenthefjords.w.uib.no/durin/).
The goal of this repo is to organize and streamline the data management in the project and beyond.

## DATA MANAGEMENT

### Location of data, metadata and code

The overview of all the **datasets** is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KlQwSkcPa09POOSV0B7i_Z5KWcKDyw_Xu7Jikc9voyA/edit?usp=sharing).

The raw and clean **datasets** from are stored and will be made available after the end of the project on [OSF](https://osf.io/f4v9t/).
For now the data is only available to the project partners.

All R code for the cleaning the raw data is available on the [Durin GitHub](https://github.com/Durin-project).

The data documentation, including a draft for the data paper is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Mky4gZfCzHIZl82zQKX6nb2vRneZXDRVDAmp0a3gdA/edit?usp=sharing) (only available for authors), and the **data dictionaries** are in this below in this readme file.

### Naming conventions for the datasets and files

We use **snake_case style** for names and coding.
Snake_case means that we use lower case letters separated by an underscore, for example *biomass_g* or *age_class*.
The one exceptionare siteID, blockID, plotID (legacy from previous projects).

**File and variable names should be meaningful**.
Do not use *my_data.csv* or *var1*.
Follow the naming convention for the main variables (see full description of the main variables in the table below).

We use **redundancy in variable names** to avoid mistakes.
PlotID should contain the higher hierarchical levels such as siteID, blockID, treatment, habitat, species etc.
For example plotID contains siteID, habitat, species and plot number: LY_O_VV_1, LY_F_VM_3

### Organize data sets

Each dataset should **contain only one response variable**, or several if they are closely related.
E.g. biomass and carbon flux should be two separate datasets.
But the functional trait dataset can contain several traits, and the carbon flux dataset can contain GPP, NEE and Reco.

Datasets should be in a **long format**.
If you have several response variables (e.g. traits, flux measurements), then use `pivot_long(cols = ..., names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")` to conver the data to a long format.
Using the names *variable* and *value* for the columns is a standard.
If you have very different response variables, it can be useful to have a column called *unit*.

When dealing with many different datasets it can be useful to structure them in a similar way.
Arrange the dataset so that the important variables come first, preferable use this order:

- Year and/or date
- siteID
- habitat
- treatment
- plotID
- plantID
- leafID
- variable (diversity, biomass, flux)
- value
- unit
- predictor_variables (temperature level, oceanity)
- other_variables (remark, data collector, weather)


### Data dictionary

**How to make a data dictionary?**

The R package **dataDocumentation** that will help you to make the data dictionary.
You can install and load the package as follows:


```{r install, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# if needed install the remotes package
install.packages("remotes")

# then install the dataDocumentation package
remotes::install_github("audhalbritter/dataDocumentation")

# and load it
library(dataDocumentation)

```


*Make data description table*

Find the file *R/data_dic/data_description.xlsx*.
Enter all the variables into that table, including variable name, description, unit/treatment level and how measured.
If the variables are global for all of Funder, leave TableID blank (e.g. siteID).
If the variable is unique for a specific dataset, create a TableID and use it consistently for one specific dataset.
Make sure you have described all variables.

*Make data dictionary*

Then run the function make_data_dic().

```{r make-dic, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

data_dic <- make_data_dictionary(data = biomass,
                                 description_table = description_table,
                                 table_ID = "biomass",
                                 keep_table_ID = FALSE)
```


Check that the function produces the correct data dictionary.

*Add data dictionary to readme file*

Finally, add the data dictionary below to be displayed in this readme file.
Add a title, and a code chunk using `kable()` to display the data dictionary.

For more details go to the [dataDocumentation readme](https://github.com/audhalbritter/dataDocumentation) file.
